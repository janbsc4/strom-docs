The idea for the Strom project came from realizing the huge energy price fluctuations in Spain. Since heating has a bit of flexibility, on which time you turn it on, there is an opportunity to pick the optimal hours and lower the energy bill.

## Proof of Concept Hackathon
Over a weekend in January 2025 we worked on the main code for Strom. We got the code to work and interact correctly with our smart plug. Despite there being a lot of room for improvement, we celebrated this first "it works" achievement.

## Dedicated hardware
In order for the code to be running, we needed an efficient piece of hardware, that could be running at all times and send updated intructions to the smart plug. This is where Le Potato V2 came into the picture.
